# Networking

**What is Networking ?**

Network is a collection of network enabled devices made of computers, switches, routers etc...

**Types of Networks**

* PAN - Personal Area Network

  Provides network around an individual, Example - Bluetooth devices. 

* LAN - Local Area Network

  Provides network around an single location like office and schools, Needs authentication and authorization to be accessed, Mostly Used.

* MAN - Metropolitan Area Network

  Provides network around two different cities provided by a collection of LAN.

* WAN - Wide Area Network

  Provides network between two different geographical locations, same as MAN, imagine a head office where its network is connected to other offices on other 
  geographical locations with the use of multiple LAN's. 

**Network Topologies**

Network topology refers how multiple devices connect to a specific network

**Types of Network Topologies**

* Bus - All the devices are connected to a single long network cable, has lot of constrains.
  
* Ring - Each network device is connected only to its neighbor to form a ring

* Mesh - Each network device is connected to all the network device around it most modern devices use this mesh topology,
  
* Star - Most commonly used network topology. Each network device connects to a centralized hub or switch. Switches and hubs can be linked together to extend and 
  build more extensive networks.

**Network Infrastructure**

 Network standard-compliant devices that make up the structure of your networks

 * Repeaters
 * Hubs
 * Bridges
 * Switches
 * Routers

  All of these devices depend on a media access control or an Internet Protocol (IP) address to deliver data on the network.

**Media Access Control**

The MAC address is the address given to the network enbled device at the time of manufacture. It has a standard composition of six hexadecimal numbers separated by a colon or dash. The first three numbers of the MAC address define the manufacturer's organizationally unique identifier (OUI), and the remaining three numbers uniquely identify the device. For example, if the MAC address is AA-6A-BA-2B-68-C1 then the OUI is AA-6A-BA and 2B-68-C1 is the device ID.
